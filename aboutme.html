Hey!

I'm Andrew Rodriguez (as you might have concluded), and this is my first true writing blog.

I made this blog because it's surprisingly easy to lose track of projects and thoughts. Every day seems to have a lot more hours when you keep yourself busy.

[Side-self-note: I want to see how much my battery charges by the time I'm done with this entry. It's currently at 10%.]

This blog will include my rambles, studies, rationalizations (as crude as some may be), and meditations in various fields of study:

<ul>
	<li>Games</li>
	<li>Music</li>
	<li>Food</li>
	<li>Life events [Things I can invite people to]</li>
	<li>Other things that I certainly care about regardless of whether or not you do</li>
</ul>

As this blog ages, each category will expand and new ones will likely emerge! If you ever wish to browse a certain field, I'd suggest you direct your attention to the "Categories" button on the left. It's probably going to be your favorite button on this site. It's already my favorite button - he looks pretty dashing, doesn't he? I heard he's having an affair with the Tumblr button despite the long distance. Don't tell anyone, it's very sensitive information! 

[Note to self: Make links to each category on this page for ease of access]

Thanks for taking your time to browse this page. And if you're reading this and sticking around, you're already my best friend. Toodles!

- Andrew

P.S.: Oh, yeah. Battery is now at 20%
